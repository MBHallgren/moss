            <b>For additional documentation on Microbial Outbreak Surveillance System, please visit: GITHUB LINK</b><br>
            <u>If this is your first time installing and using Microbial Outbreak Surveillance System (MOSS), please read and follow the set-up guide carefully.<br>
              Additionally, the instructions on how to correctly operating MOSS should be thoroughly studied.</u>

              <li><b>Initializing your first surveillance system</b></li>
             If you have just downloaded (Cloned) MOSS from github/bitbucket, you will need to either generate a new MOSS system or download an existing one.
             <ol>
               <li><b>Initializing a new MOSS system</b></li>
               MANGLER
               <li><b>Downloading and configuring an existing MOSS system</b></li>
               MANGLER
             </ol>
              <li><b>Analyzing isolate samples</b></li>
              <li><b>Analysis reports</b></li>
              <li><b>Analysis status</b></li>
              In order to check the status of an analysis, click the History tab in the action bar to the left.
             If the analysis has finished, it will be shown under "Show Finished Analyses". Otherwise, it will be shown under "Show Running Analyses".
             <li><b>General considerations when using MOSS</b></li>
             Some of the bioinformatical programs run during the MOSS pipeline can be quite computationally requiring,
             and therefore any user should consider the natural limitations of their hardware. The two primary areas of
             concern are running multiple analyses in parallel and performing de novo assembly. De novo assembly is extremely
             demanding in terms of RAM usage, as the De Bruijn graph needs to be stored in the memory in order to determine the next building edge.
             It is not uncommon for De Bruijn graph of bacterial assemblies of 5M BP size to use upwards of 1-3 Gb RAM. Therefore,
             if 5 samples are run in parallel and they all fail to identify a proper reference, the RAM usage for graph building could easily be in the 10-20 gb range.
             For these reasons, it is <b>strongly</b> recommended that a computer build for running MOSS has atleast 16 gb ram - Ideally 32 or even 64.
             <br>Additionally, a good CPU should be utilized, especially if isolate samples are to be run in parallel. The recommended number of cores are <b>atleast</b> 12.
